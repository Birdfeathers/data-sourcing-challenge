# data-sourcing-challenge
This is an assignment for my Artificial intelligence bootcamp at DU. It uses python and pandas to:
    * retrieve data on CMEs and GSTs from the Nasa API
    * clean the data
    * merge the data where there are CMEs linked to GSTs
    * calculate the average time between a CME and GST
    * export the data to an ouput file
